1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we initialize a repository with git init git creates a .git folder to start the process of tracking and version control.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A Staging Area allows you to logically separate your commits of one or multiple files. You could add logically related files to the staging area and then commit.


3) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Add all logical change related files to the staging area using git add and then finally commit.

4) What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches allow you to move along a different path or feature addition without affecting the main build/code - so in a way you could have a master branch running and have other experimental or new feature branches without impacting the production code.

5) How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Diagrams are a great way to see visually the branches and commits and the spokes that branch out of the master branch.
Diagrams also help us to see if there's any commit lying around with no branch-name.
With visualization it is easy to track back to the head node.

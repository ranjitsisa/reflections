1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we initialize a repository with git init git creates a .git folder to start the process of tracking and version control.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A Staging Area allows you to logically separate your commits of one or multiple files. You could add logically related files to the staging area and then commit.
